// This Dialog class implements a pop-up dialog.  This is needed because
// apparently you can't use the standard AWT Dialog from within an applet.  The
// dialog can be made visible by calling its showDialog() method.  Dialogs can
// be modal or non-modal.  For a modal dialog box, the showDialog() method must
// be called from a thread other than the GUI thread, and it only returns when
// the dialog box has been dismissed.  For a non-modal dialog box, the
// showDialog() method returns immediately.
